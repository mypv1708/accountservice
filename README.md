Project Description:

This project demonstrates the integration of Spring Boot with Apache Kafka to implement a scalable and reliable messaging system for asynchronous communication between microservices. The application is designed to produce and consume messages in a Kafka topic to enable seamless event-driven architecture.

Key Features:
Kafka Producer: A Spring Boot service that publishes messages (events) to a Kafka topic. This could be event data such as user activities, transaction details, or system logs.
Kafka Consumer: A Spring Boot service that listens to Kafka topics and processes messages in real-time, supporting multiple consumers for scalable message processing.
Spring Kafka Integration: Utilizes Spring Kafka to simplify the configuration of Kafka producer and consumer, leveraging Springâ€™s dependency injection and configuration properties.
Asynchronous Processing: Kafka's publish-subscribe model enables non-blocking communication between services, improving performance and reducing coupling.
Error Handling & Retries: Built-in mechanisms for handling failures during message consumption, with configurable retries and dead-letter topics for undeliverable messages.
Use Cases:
Real-time data processing: Streaming analytics, real-time notifications, or event-driven workflows.
Microservice communication: Asynchronous communication between loosely coupled microservices.
Log aggregation: Collecting and processing system logs from distributed services in real-time.
Technologies Used:
Spring Boot: To create microservices with minimal configuration.
Apache Kafka: For distributed messaging and streaming data between services.
Spring Kafka: To facilitate integration between Spring Boot and Kafka.
ZooKeeper: (Optional) For Kafka cluster management.
Docker: To containerize the application and Kafka broker for easy deployment.
